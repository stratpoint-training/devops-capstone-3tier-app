# DevOps Implementation Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through implementing DevOps practices for a simple task management application. Don't worry if some concepts are new - we'll explain everything step by step.

## The Big Picture

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand what we're building:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Code] --> B[GitLab CI]
    B --> C[Container Registry]
    C --> D[ArgoCD]
    D --> E[Kubernetes]
    E --> F[Running App]
```

1. You'll write code and push to GitLab
2. GitLab CI automatically builds container images
3. ArgoCD watches for changes and updates Kubernetes
4. Your app runs in Kubernetes

This is called a "GitOps" workflow - everything starts with a git push!

## Starting Point: The Sample App

We'll use a simple task management application (provided in the `/app` directory) to learn DevOps practices. It has three parts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend: React] --> B[Backend: Node.js]
    B --> C[Database: PostgreSQL]
```

First, let's make sure you can run it locally:
   ```bash
   cd app
   docker compose up
   ```

2. Test that it works:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (React dev server)
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001
   - Try the features:
     * Create a task
     * Update its status
     * Delete the task

## Your Learning Journey

We'll implement DevOps practices in small, manageable steps:

### Week 1: Building the Foundation
```mermaid
timeline
    Local Setup : Run app locally
                : Set up Kubernetes
                : Learn basic commands
    Helm : Package app
         : Configure deployment
         : Test locally
```

### Week 2: Automation & GitOps
```mermaid
timeline
    GitLab CI : Set up repository
              : Create pipeline
              : Build containers
    ArgoCD : Install ArgoCD
           : Configure sync
           : Deploy app
```

### Week 3-4: Observability & Monitoring
```mermaid
timeline
    Observability Stack : Install Prometheus
                        : Configure Grafana
                        : Set up Loki & Tempo
    Application Monitoring : Instrument code
                           : Create dashboards
                           : Configure alerts
```

You'll learn to:

1. **Local Kubernetes Setup**
   - Choose a local Kubernetes solution
   - Set up your cluster
   - Learn basic Kubernetes concepts

2. **Helm Chart Creation**
   - Package the application
   - Configure deployments
   - Manage different environments

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitLab CI
   - Build containers
   - Automate deployments

4. **GitOps with ArgoCD**
   - Install ArgoCD
   - Configure applications
   - Implement GitOps workflow

5. **Observability Stack**
   - Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
   - Create monitoring dashboards
   - Set up alerting and instrumentation
